# mlp-cnn-cifar10

This project focuses on building and training neural networks using the PyTorch library to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 pixel images in 10 classes (such as cats, dogs, cars, and more). The goal is to implement two models: a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and evaluate their performance in classifying the images.
